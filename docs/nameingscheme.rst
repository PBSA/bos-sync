*************
Naming Scheme
*************

Some bookiesports files (in particular ``name`` and ``description``
fields) allow the use of *variables*. Those are dynamic and filled in by
``bookie-sync``, automatically.

As an example, the file ``MLB_ML_1.yaml`` defines betting markets for a
Moneyline market group. The betting markets carry the name of the event
participants. We encode this in bookiesports using *variables*:::

     bettingmarkets:
          - description:
              en: '{teams.away}'
          - description:
              en: '{teams.home}'


Overview of variables
---------------------

* ``teams``:

  * ``{teams.home}``: Home team
  * ``{teams.away}``: Away team

* ``result``:

  * ``{teams.home}``: Points for home team
  * ``{teams.away}``: Points for away team
  * ``{teams.hometeam}``: Points for home team
  * ``{teams.awayteam}``: Points for away team
  * ``{teams.total}``: Total Points

* ``handicaps``:

  * ``{teams.home}``: Comparative (symmetric) Handicaps (e.g., `+-2`) for home team
  * ``{teams.away}``: Comparative (symmetric) Handicaps (e.g., `+-2`) for away team
  * ``{teams.home_score}``: Absolute handicap for home team (e.g., `2`)
  * ``{teams.away_score}``: Absolute handicap for away team (e.g., `0`)

* ``overunder``:

  * ``{teams.value}``: The over-/under value


Internal Processing
-------------------

The variable parsing is done in ``bos-sync`` (``substitutions.py``) and
work through ``decode_variables`` and a few classes that deal with the
variables. This allows us to have complex variable substitutions.

The variables all consist of a **module identifier** and the actual
**member variable**:::

    {module.member}

All modules are listed in the ``substitutions`` variable in
``decode_variables``:::

    substitutions = {
        "teams": Teams,
        "result": Result,
        "handicaps": Handicaps,
        "overunder": OverUnder,
    }

The modules themselves (capital first letter) are defined in the same
file and can be as easy as

.. code-block:: python

     class Result:
         """ Defines a few variables to be used as {result.X}
         """
         def __init__(self, **kwargs):
             result = kwargs.get("result", [0, 0]) or [0, 0]
             self.hometeam = result[0]
             self.awayteam = result[1]

             self.total = sum([float(x) for x in result])

             # aliases
             self.home = self.hometeam
             self.away = self.awayteam

and as complex as

.. code-block:: python

    class Teams:
        """ Defines a few variables to be used as {teams.X}
        """
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            teams = kwargs.get("teams", ["", ""]) or ["", ""]
            self.home = " ".join([
                x.capitalize() for x in teams[0].split(" ")])
            self.away = " ".join([
                x.capitalize() for x in teams[1].split(" ")])
